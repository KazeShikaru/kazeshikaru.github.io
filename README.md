# UBE Emblem
First attempt at javascript.

Through this project I have attempted to create a game in javascript canvas. 
I am learning about the potential of javascript and the ease to create easily accessible content for the internet.

This game is supposed to be a satire of the Fire Emblem games, including similar gameplay and theme.

Art is being created by my colleagues to replace the stock images currently present. 






Please hire me...
